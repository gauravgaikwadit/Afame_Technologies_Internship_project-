                                                ---- OBJECTIVE -------

1 ] Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

2 ] In businesses that offer products or services, the role of a Data Scientist is crucial for predicting future sales.

3 ] They utilize machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs.

4 ]By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.
